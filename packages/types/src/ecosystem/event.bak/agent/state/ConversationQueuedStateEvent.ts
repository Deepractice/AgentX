/**
 * Conversation Queued State Event (L2: State Layer)
 *
 * State transition: Idle → Queued
 *
 * Emitted when a user message is received and queued for processing.
 * This is the first state in the conversation lifecycle, indicating
 * the message has been accepted but the agent hasn't started processing yet.
 *
 * Typical flow:
 * idle → queued → conversation_active → thinking → responding → idle
