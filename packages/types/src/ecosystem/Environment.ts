/**
 * Environment - External world that the Agent perceives
 *
 * From systems theory:
 * - Environment is everything outside the system boundary
 * - The system (Agent) perceives the environment through Receptors
 * - The system acts upon the environment through Effectors
 *
 * Environment is NOT just an event filter - it converts external information
 * (which may not be events) into EnvironmentEvents that the system cares about.
 *
 * Analogy: Reading a newspaper, you only read news you care about.
 *
 * Different Environment implementations:
 * - ClaudeEnvironment: Perceives Claude SDK, emits text_chunk, tool_call, etc.
 * - WebSocketEnvironment: Perceives WebSocket messages, emits same event types
 * - MockEnvironment: For testing
 *
 * @see issues/027-systems-theory-agent-environment.md
