### Patch Changes

- 5749112: refactor(ui): unify assistant message lifecycle with single component

  **Major Changes:**
  - Consolidated `ThinkingMessage` and `StreamingMessage` into a single `AssistantMessage` component that handles all lifecycle states
  - Added message-level status types: `UserMessageStatus` and `AssistantMessageStatus`
  - Implemented complete status flow: `queued → thinking → responding → success`
  - Created comprehensive Stories for `AssistantMessage` and `ToolMessage` components

  **Technical Improvements:**
  - Applied single responsibility principle - one component manages all assistant message states
  - Added `useAgent` hook to manage assistant message status transitions automatically
  - Improved Chat component with unified message rendering logic
  - Fixed `RuntimeOperations.getImageMessages` type signature to use proper `Message[]` type

  **UI Enhancements:**
  - `queued` state: "Queue..." with animated dots
  - `thinking` state: "Thinking..." with animated dots
  - `responding` state: Streaming text with cursor animation
  - `success` state: Complete rendered message

  This refactoring significantly improves code maintainability and provides a clearer mental model for message lifecycle management.

### Patch Changes

- da67096: fix(runtime): pass sandbox workdir path as cwd to Claude SDK

  Previously, the cwd parameter was not being passed from RuntimeAgent to ClaudeEnvironment, causing the Claude SDK to run in the default working directory instead of the agent's isolated sandbox workdir. This fix ensures each agent operates within its designated working directory at `~/.agentx/containers/{containerId}/workdirs/{agentId}/`.
