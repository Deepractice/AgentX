/**
 * AgentX Core Interfaces
 *
 * SPI (Service Provider Interface) contracts for agentx-core.
 * These interfaces define the contracts for:
 * - AgentService: User-facing agent runtime API
 * - AgentDriver: Platform-specific LLM driver implementations
 * - AgentLogger: Platform-specific logging implementations
 * - AgentReactor: Event processing units (low-level)
 * - Layer-specific Reactors: User-friendly interfaces for 4-layer event handling
 *
 * Third-party implementations should depend on these interfaces.
